# FLAPPY-BIRD

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using JavaScript and React. It's a fun and addictive game where you control a bird, trying to navigate it through a series of pipes without hitting them.

1. Controls:

    Use the left mouse button to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
    Avoid hitting the pipes.

2. Objective:

    The objective is to navigate the bird through as many pipes as possible without crashing.
    Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns you one point.

3. Game Over:

    The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
